I am a 1st-year PhD student in the National PhD in Artificial Intelligence, working at University of Verona under the supervision of prof. [Rosalba Giugno](https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=35790) at the [InfOmics](https://infomics.github.io/InfOmics/) lab. I work on DNA sequence modeling, with a particular focus on Recurrent architectures and interpretability. My research explores how modern machine learning architectures can provide insights into biological sequences and their underlying mechanisms. 

Before my PhD, I earned an MSc in Medical Bioinformatics at the University of Verona. My thesis, “Unveiling novel Gene-Drug-Disease Interactions with BERTWalk embeddings and Neural Networks”, focused on applying graph embedding techniques to predict drug-disease interactions. Prior to that, I obtained a BSc in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Bologna, where I worked with prof. [Matteo Cerri](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/matteo.cerri) on the analysis of electroencephalographic signals in NREM sleep after synthetic torpor.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
